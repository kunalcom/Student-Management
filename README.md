# Student-Management
Tasks performed -->
* Imported the  array of students data into your HTML and JavaScript project.
* Create a user interface (UI) based on the design provided in Figma.
* Displayed all 100 elements from the array in a table format. Ensuring the "Name" column displays an image of the student along with their full name (first name + last name). Additionally, showed "passing" or "failed" instead of the boolean value in the "Passing" column.
* Implemented a search bar to filter table data based on first name, last name, and email. The search should be case insensitive and can be triggered by either typing in the search bar or clicking a search button.
* Created a flex-box layout for buttons with maximum space between them.
* Implemented sorting functionality for the array based on different criteria:
Sort A->Z: Ascending order of full name
Sort Z->A: Descending order of full name
Sort by marks: Ascending order of marks
Sort by passing: Show only passing students
Sort by class: Ascending order of class
Sort by gender: Display two tables, one for female students and one for male students, shown one below the other.
